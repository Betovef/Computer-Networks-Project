The design relies heavily on efficiency where actions are only carried out if necessary. Routes with a cost of infinity (or a very large number in this case) are not sent. Nodes will only notify neighbors when the distance vector changes and neighbors will only notify neighbors if it is necessary. The RIP implemenation also contains the split horizon and poison reverse implmenations.
